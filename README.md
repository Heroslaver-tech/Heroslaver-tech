## 💼 About Me

I am a Systems Engineer at Universidad del Valle, with hands-on experience in the financial and academic sectors. My journey includes working as a full-stack developer, a web editor at Universidad del Valle, and a trainee professional at Banco de Occidente.

I have a strong foundation in programming (JavaScript, Python, and bash) and full-stack web development, with a focus on building scalable, secure, and SEO-optimized applications. My skill set includes modern frameworks and tools such as **Next.js, React.js, Django, Firebase, Express.js, and Node.js**, using **RESTful API design** and database management (SQL and NoSQL).

Additionally, I’m experienced in deploying applications using **Docker-Compose, Jenkins, and Kubernetes**, and I’ve explored **3D modeling with Blender** and its web integration using **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber**.
